Continued_Fraction_Expansion
============================

Calculates the continued fraction expansion of a number

Takes two input:
  terms - the number of terms in the expansion to calculate
  precision - the number of significant digits to keep in the calculation
  
By default this will plot the log of the difference between the expansion and the 'actual' value as a function of the number of terms in the expansion for four irrational numers: The golden ration, pi, e, and root(2).
